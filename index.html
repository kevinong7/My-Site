        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p class="technology-skill-description">I am enrolled at Western Governors University in their Bachelor's of Software Engineering program where I will specialize in Java. Beforehand, I have taken courses on Udemy to learn Full Stack Web Development using HTML, CSS, and
          Javascript. I have also taken some courses on freecodecamp.org where I learned a bit of Python. I have found that I truly enjoy coding and have likened it to playing Piano and creating music. I currently work as an IT Systems Administrator
          in an automotive environment. Some of my responsibilities as a System Administrator include ensuring that all systems in our environment are running smoothly, creating and maintaining users, deploying computers and printers, CISCO phone
          administration and supporting specialized software that we launch within our environment</p>

        <h3>Cars</h3>
        <p class="car-skill-description">Another passion of mine is cars. As a kid, I loved spending my arcade visits on racing games. I would draw large crowds by defeating many people much older than me in these head to head games. Growing up, I also watched a Japanese animated
          show called 'Initial D'. In this animated show, many of the characters would test their drift skills in races through the twisty mountains of Japan. A drift is where the driver of a vehicle purposefully oversteers to cause a loss of
          traction, which allows the vehicle to overcome a turn while the vehicle is sideways. In present time, I have purchased my own race simulator set up at home where I have learned to master this form of driving.</p>
